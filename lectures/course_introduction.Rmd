# Keeping the "Science" in Data Science

## Domain Knowledge

**Domain knowledge** is knowledge of a specific, specialized discipline or field, in contrast to general (or domain-independent) knowledge. For example, in describing a software engineer may have general knowledge of computer programming as well as domain knowledge about developing programs for a particular industry. People with domain knowledge are often regarded as specialists or experts in their field. (Wikipedia!)
